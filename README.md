# Python-Turtle-Graphics-Project

# Description

## This program  will basically mimic a bored turtle who decides to go on vacation. It has been given two options whether to move to California or Washington. If it chooses California the map will choose the location and picks a place near the mountain area. Then it builds a house and a Christmas tree and spends some time there. If it chooses Washington, it'll go to a small town somewhere in washington and builds a house there. It plants trees around it's house and enjoys the sunny weather among the shades of the trees it planted. Then it gets a chance to see some amazing rainbow in the evening and then spends the whole night gazing at the moon and the stars around its house.
